## Sales Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
**Project Overview**
This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a synthetically generated sales dataset using Python. The dataset simulates sales transactions across multiple product categories, regions, and customer segments. The aim is to extract meaningful insights through data quality checks, univariate, bivariate analysis, time series trends, and advanced statistical correlations.

**Data Generation**
The dataset of 1000 records is generated using the Faker library, simulating realistic order, customer, product, and supplier details including order dates, sales amounts, discounts, profit calculations, stock levels, and delivery statuses.

**Key Analyses Performed**
- Data quality assessment with checks for missing values and duplicates.
- Data type conversion and validation.
- Univariate analysis for categorical and numerical variables with visualizations.
- Bivariate analysis of sales and profits by category and region with bar charts and pie charts.
- Time series analysis of monthly sales, profit, and order trends.
- Correlation heatmap of key numerical variables.
- Customer segment-wise sales and profit analysis.
- Summary of key metrics including top-performing categories, regional and customer segment performance, and delivery status distribution.

**Tools and Libraries**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Faker (for data generation)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Output**
- Cleaned dataset saved as sales_data.csv.
- Analysis results saved as sales_analysis_results.csv.
- Various insightful visualizations for interpretation.
